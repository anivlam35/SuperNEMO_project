First of all: paths to be changed in all *.cpp files.

#### quality_evets_search.cp ####
Extracts event numbers from $PATH_TO_TKEVENT$/TKEvent/runs/Run-*.root to the quality histogram (quality_file.root).
You need to run it first. It is better to send to the cluster.

#### high_quality_events_listing.cpp ####
Creates a file (events_with_quality_from_$LOWER_Q$_to_$UPPER_Q$.root) with event numbers that are within the 
specified quality range (the user enters the lower and upper quality limits).

Other:
## quality_histo_creation.cpp ##
Visualize the histogram of event quality.

## example_events_quality.cpp ##
Visualization of example events from some quality bin. Must be modified for each use case.
